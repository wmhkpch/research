## MSc Health Data Science Dissertation (UCL)

**Title:**  
Machine Learning and Clinician Predictions of Antibiotic Resistance  

**Focus:**  
Predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Gram-negative bloodstream infections using real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from UCLH.

**Key Contributions:**
- Built and evaluated **logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost** models for antibiotic resistance prediction
- Designed **time-aware feature engineering** using microbiology, prescriptions, ICD-10 comorbidities, and prior resistance history
- Compared **pre-species (empiric)** vs **post-species** prediction stages
- Applied **SHAP interpretability** to ensure clinical transparency
- Performed **bug–drug mismatch analysis** to quantify real-world prescribing impact
- Benchmarked results against published Oxford models

**Key Findings:**
- Logistic regression provided the best balance of performance and interpretability
- Model-guided prescribing reduced empiric mismatch by up to **10.2%** (ceftriaxone)
- Demonstrated clear potential for clinical decision support in antimicrobial stewardship
